SoftCore
=====

A simple Minecraft (CraftBukkit) plugin targeted at Ultra Hardcore gameplay. 
This mod is not intended to be played with hardcore difficulty. Instead players are punished by beeing spawned far away after they died.
One could say this might rather be "Softcore"...

* Adds Chainmail recipies. (take a look at recipepictures/)
* Replaces Golden Apple and Glistering Melon recipes to use Gold Ingots instead of Gold Nuggets.
* Prevents health regeneration if the players food bar is full.
* Players respawn between 500 and 1000 units away of the original spawn-location after they died
